-- Dismantle Sites
-- ---------------
--
-- The dismantlesite is a special building.
-- It is a building site where a building is being dismantled.
-- Just like the constructionsite, it is defined only once for all tribes.
--
-- The dismantlesite is defined in
-- ``buildings/partially_finished/dismantlesite/init.lua``.
-- The building will also need its help texts, which are defined in
-- ``buildings/partially_finished/dismantlesite/helptexts.lua``

dirname = path.dirname(__file__)

-- RST
-- .. function:: new_dismantlesite_type(table)
