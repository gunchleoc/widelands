-- Production Sites
-- ----------------
--
-- Productionsites are a type of building where wares are being consumed to
-- produce other wares, or to produce workers.
-- They also have workers working at them.
--
-- Productionsites are defined in
-- ``data/tribes/buildings/productionsites/<tribe_name>/<building_name>/init.lua``.
-- The building will also need its help texts, which are defined in
-- ``data/tribes/buildings/productionsites/<tribe_name>/<building_name>/helptexts.lua``

-- .. function:: new_productionsite_type(table)
--
--    This function adds the definition of a production site building to the engine.
--
--    :arg table: This table contains all the data that the game engine will add to this building.
--                It contains the following entries:
--
--    **msgctxt**: The context that Gettext will use to disambiguate the translations for strings in this table.
--
--    **name**: A string containing the internal name of this building.
--
--    **descname**: The translatable display name. Use ``pgettext`` with the ``msgctxt`` above to fetch the string.
--
--    **helptext_script**: The full path to the ``helptexts.lua`` script for this building.
--
--    **icon**: The full path to the menu icon for this building.
--
--    **size**: The size of this building: ``"small"``, ``"medium"``, ``"big"`` or ``"mine"``.
--
--    **buildcost**: A table with the wares used to build this building, containing warename - amount pairs, e.g. ``buildcost = { log = 4, granite = 2 }``.
--
--    **return_on_dismantle**: The wares that this building will give back to the player when it is dismantled, e.g. ``buildcost = { log = 2, granite = 1 }``.
--
--    **enhancement_cost**: The wares needed to upgrade this building, e.g. ``enhancement_cost = { log = 1, granite = 1 }``.
--
--    **return_on_dismantle_on_enhanced**: The wares that this enhanced building will give back to the player when it is dismantled, e.g. ``return_on_dismantle_on_enhanced = { granite = 1 }``.
--
--    **animations**: A table containing all animations for this building.
--
--    **aihints**: A list of name - value pairs with hints for the AI.
--
--    **working_positions**: The name and amount for each worker type working at this building.
--
--    **inputs**: The name and amount for each ware input queue.
--
--    **outputs**: The wares/workers produced by this building.
--
--    **programs**: The production site programs that define what preconditions
--    a building needs to fulfil in order to produce its wares and how it's done,
--    including any animations and sounds played. See also :doc:`productionsite_program`.
--
--    **out_of_resource_notification**: This optional table defines the message
--    sent by the productionsite to the player if it has run out of a resource to
--    collect. Table keys are:
--
--        *title*: A concise message title for the list in the inbox.
--
--        *heading*: A longer version of the title, shown in the message body.
--
--        *message*: The actual message. Translation needs to be fetched with pgettext.
--
--        *productivity_threshold*: An optional int value in percent to trigger the message.
