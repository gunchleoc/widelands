-- Building Helptexts
-- ------------------
--
-- Each building has a ``helptexts.lua`` script, which is located in the same directory as its ``init.lua`` script.
-- The functions in this file return texts that are used for buildings by the Tribal Encyclopedia.
--
-- See also the helper functions in ``scripting/help/global_helptexts.lua``
--

-- This include can be removed when all help texts have been defined.
