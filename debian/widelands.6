.SH "DESCRIPTION"

In this game, you start out on a small piece of land with nothing more than
a few of useful resources. Using those, you can build yourself an empire
with many thousands of inhabitants. On your way towards this goal, you will
have to build up an economic infrastructure, explore the lands around you
and face enemies who are trying to rule the world just like you do.

.SH "LONG DESCRIPTION"

In Widelands, you are the regent of a small tribe. You start out with
nothing but your headquarters, a kind of castle in which all your resources
are stored. In the course of the game, you will build an ever growing
settlement. Every member of your tribe will do his or her part to produce
more resources - wood, food, iron, gold and more - to further this growth.
But you are not alone in the world, and you will meet other tribes sooner or
later. Some of them may be friendly and trade with you. However, if you want
to rule the world, you will have to train soldiers and fight.

Widelands offers a unique style of play. For example, a system of roads
plays the central role of your economy: all the goods that are harvested and
processed by the tribe must be transported from one building to the next.
This is done by carriers, and those carriers always walk along the roads. It
is your job to lay out the roads as efficiently as possible.

Another refreshing aspect of the game is the way you command your tribe.
There is no need to tell every single one of your subjects what to do - that
would be impossible, because there can be thousands of them! Instead, all
you've got to do is order them to build a building somewhere, and the
builders will come.
Similarly, whenever you want to attack an enemy, just place an order to
attack one of their barracks, and your soldiers will march to fight.
You're really a ruler: You delegate in times of war and in times of peace!

Widelands offers single-player mode with different campaigns; the campaigns
all tell the story of a tribe and it's struggle in the Widelands universe!
However, settling really starts when you unite with friends over the
Internet or LAN to build up new empires together - or to crush each other in
the dusts of war.
Widelands also offers an Artifical Intelligent to challenge.

In the end, Widelands will be extensible, so that you can create your own
type of tribe with their own sets of buildings. You can create new worlds to
play in, and you could even create new types of worlds (who says you can't
build a settlement on the moon?).
