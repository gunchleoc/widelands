Defining Tribes
===============

Each tribe is bootstrapped with the following scripts:

* ``data/tribes/tribes/<tribe_name>/init.lua``: Provides basic information about a
  tribe to the game launching screens. The player won't be able to select a
  tribe without it being defined in such a file.
* ``data/tribes/tribes/<tribe_name>/units.lua``: These scripts tell the engine which units
  belong to each tribe. They also define some global animated images for each
  tribe (flags, borders, roads).

The tribe objects are then defined by the following scripts:

* ``data/tribes/<path>/init.lua``: This file defines the map objects to load
  from its path.
* ``data/tribes/<path>/register.lua``: This file has to list the names of all
  objects defined in the path's ``init.lua`` file. Only tribe objects that are
  listed in these files will be registered for loading, and the names must match
  with the respective ``init.lua`` file. Attributes are also defined here.
* See :ref:`defining_tribe_units` for further details.
