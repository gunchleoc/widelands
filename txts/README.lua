[[Introduction]]
   ) .. p(_
[[Widelands is a free, open source real-time strategy game with singleplayer
campaigns and a multiplayer mode. The game was inspired by Settlers II but has
significantly more variety and depth to it. Still, it is easy to get started
through playable tutorials.]]
   ) .. p(_
[[In this game, you start out on a small piece of land with just a few
resources. Using these, you’ll create an empire with many thousands of
inhabitants. On your way towards this goal, you will have to establish an
economic infrastructure, explore the land around you and face rivaling
tribes.]]

[[Widelands is nearly feature complete and is much fun to play alone and even
more in multiplayer with others. Still, there is always more work to be done in
all areas. If you are interested in contributing – be it by making graphics,
fixing bugs or adding new features, translating the game into your language or
creating new maps – get in touch on our homepage.]])

[[Replays]]
   ) .. p(_
[[Widelands records every game you play in two files. One of these files has a
.wrpl.wgf extension and contains an initial savegame. The other file has a
.wrpl extension and contains all commands that were issued by all players, such
as building a road or attacking an enemy. The rest of the filenames will tell
you the time you started the game.]]
   ) .. p(_
[[Using the Watch Replay option in the main menu, a previously played game will
be precisely reconstructed for you to watch. Note, however, that even small
changes in the game data files or the Widelands executable can cause a replay
to become incompatible and to ‘go out of sync’. This is similar to how network
games will suffer from desynchronization problems if one of the players has a
different version of the game.]]
   ) .. p(_
[[Replays are a very useful tool to find bugs in the game logic, so they
can be useful as attachments to bug reports. The replay files are saved in the
~/.widelands/replays directory on Linux and Mac OS X. On Windows,
they are in the ‘replays’ subdirectory of your Widelands installation.]]
