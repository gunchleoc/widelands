/**
 * Each Economy represents all building and flags, which are connected over the same
 * street network. In general a player can own multiple Economys, which
 * operate independently from each other.
 *
 * Every Economy tracks the amount of wares inside of it and how high the
 * demand for each ware is.
 *
 * \paragraph Merging and splitting
 *
 * During the course of a game Economy objects can be merged when new roads and ports are created,
 * or split when roads and ports are destroyed.
 *
 * Splitting and merging economies are relatively expensive operations,
 * and in particular during game shutdown or when a large network is destroyed
 * in a military operation, cascading economy splits could take a lot of processing time.
 * For this reason, economies do not split immediately when a road is destroyed,
 * but instead keep track of where a potential split occured and evaluate the split lazily.
 *
 * This means that two flags which are connected by the road (and seafaring) network
 * are \b always in the same economy, but two flags in the same economy are not always
 * connected by roads or the seafaring network - though of course, most code operates
 * on the assumption that they are, with fallbacks for when they aren't.
