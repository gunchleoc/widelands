/**
 * This class represents anything that can be rendered to.
 *
 * It supports windows, which are composed of a clip rectangle and a drawing
 * offset:
 * The drawing offset will be added to all coordinates that are passed to
 * drawing routines. Therefore, the offset is usually negative. Then the
 * coordinates are interpreted as relative to the clip rectangle and the
 * primitives are clipped accordingly.
 * \ref enter_window() can be used to enter a sub-window of the current window.
 * When you're finished drawing in the window, restore the old window by calling
 * \ref set_window() with the values stored in previous and prevofs.
 * \note If the sub-window would be empty/invisible, \ref enter_window() returns
 * false and doesn't change the window state at all.
