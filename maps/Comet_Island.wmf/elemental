descr=_"A few miles in front of Gerion Coast lies a small unnamed island. Until now, you have not seen any reason to sail there, but yesterday a big fireball came from the sky and touched down in its center. Is this a sign of the Gods? You believe it is and you hope that your tribe will find the treasure of this island before other tribes will follow."
